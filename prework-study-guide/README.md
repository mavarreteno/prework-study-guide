# Prework Study Guide

## Description

A study guide for the prework modules. Here we see important information which we learned during the prework modules, as well as some commonly used comands both in Git and in Windows. We have information formatted in a way that helps you focus on a specific topic or altogether can help you navigate through the basics of programming languages used in the development of web applications.

 This prework study guide breaksdown the information into topics such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. That way we can focus on a particular topic that may be giving you trouble. If you cannot decide which topic to study, you may open up DevTools (see Keyboard shortcuts) to see the topics listed out, and you can even receive a suggestion on which topic to study first!
